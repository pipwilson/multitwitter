Multitwitter
============

Allows multiple users to post to the same Twitter account via an XMPP 
bot.

Code is based on twitterpated http://code.google.com/p/twitterpated/ by 
Kellan.

This code does *not* run on Windows due to the use of the 'daemons' gem.

Configuration
-------------

Create a new user on your XMPP server for multitwitter to log in as.

Copy config.yml.example to config.yml
Add the XMPP IDs of the users you want to be able to post to Twitter
Add the the XMPP ID and password of the multitwitter user
Add the username and password of the Twitter account that multitwitter will be adding to

Usage
-----

Usage: ruby multitwitter_daemon.rb run|start -- -f config.yml 

Multitwitter will start and  add the users listed in the "allowed" to its userlist.

Anyone on the "allowed" list will be able to send it messages which will then get reposted to Twitter.
